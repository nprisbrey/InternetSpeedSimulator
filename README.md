# Internet Speed Simulator
This website simulates how fast different at-home internet connections in the United States loads. They're positioned in order by relative speed and state roughly how many households in the United States subscribe to each type of internet connection at home. Note that the numbers are by **households** of people, not number of people.

## Usage
Click on each of the different media below to simulate their loading time. Smaller images (faster load times) are towards the left and larger images (large enough to simulate loading a small webpage) are towards the right. Can you imagine yours being one of the ~28 million homes with Dial-Up or No Internet?

## Examples
### Example 1
A screenshot of the largest image, the Rainbow, being loaded across different speeds of internet connections.
